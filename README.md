# GIPHYAPI
A test using the giphy api. Simple stylings are done with css. The program uses two 
functions and three event listners. The page lets users load gifs from the giphy api 
and starts with a preloaded array of options. The user is allowed to add their own options 
to the array which will load gifs from the giphy api. These pictures are loaded in their 
static state and upon clicking the images they will animate until they are clicked on 
again.
